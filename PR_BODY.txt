## Summary

Major refactor of the guess bot to improve user experience, efficiency, and cost optimization.

### Key Changes

**🤖 Auto-Guessing Workflow**
- Receipt processing now automatically triggers item name guessing
- No manual `/guess process` command needed
- Seamless user experience: upload → OCR → parse → guess → done

**📋 Simplified Commands**
- ✅ Kept: `/guess correct` - save manual corrections
- ✅ Kept: `/guess mappings` - view learned corrections
- ❌ Removed: `/guess process` - now automatic
- ❌ Removed: `/guess clear` - per user request

**🔧 OpenRouter SDK Migration**
- Migrated from custom HTTP to official `openrouter` Python SDK
- Added `openrouter>=1.0.0` to requirements
- Better error handling, type safety, and maintainability

**⚡ Batch Processing**
- Implemented `guess_batch()` for processing multiple items at once
- Single API call instead of sequential per-item calls
- Significantly faster processing

**💰 Cost Optimization**
- Switched from `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct` to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- OpenAI's cheapest model
- Batch requests reduce API call count
- Corrections cache avoids redundant calls

### Files Modified

- `bot/services/guesser.py` - Complete rewrite with OpenRouter SDK, batch processing
- `bot/cogs/guess.py` - Removed 2 commands, kept 2 essential ones
- `bot/cogs/receipt.py` - Added auto-guessing after OCR
- `bot/config.py` - Updated default model to gpt-4o-mini
- `bot/main.py` - Pass guesser to ReceiptCog
- `requirements.txt` - Added openrouter>=1.0.0
- `tests/test_guesser.py` - Updated for batch processing

### Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Automatic workflow, progress messages, clear feedback
2. **Faster**: Batch API calls reduce latency
3. **Cheaper**: gpt-4o-mini model + fewer API calls
4. **Simpler**: Fewer commands, cleaner code, official SDK
