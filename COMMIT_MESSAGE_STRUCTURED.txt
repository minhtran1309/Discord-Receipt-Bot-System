Implement Mistral OCR structured extraction with Pydantic schemas

Major enhancement to receipt processing using Mistral OCR's document_annotation_format feature for structured data extraction instead of regex parsing.

**Core Changes:**

1. **Enhanced Data Models (bot/models.py)**
   - Added `discount`, `sku`, `language` fields to ReceiptItem
   - Added `subtotal`, `tax`, `discount_total`, `payment_method` to Receipt
   - All fields include descriptions for better OCR extraction

2. **OCR Extraction Schemas (bot/services/ocr.py)**
   - Created `OCRReceiptItem` schema for item-level extraction
   - Created `OCRReceiptData` schema for complete receipt extraction
   - Implemented structured extraction using `response_format_from_pydantic_model`
   - Added MIME type detection for JPEG, PNG, HEIC formats
   - Configured table_format="html" to preserve table structure
   - Fallback to basic markdown extraction if structured fails

3. **Receipt Processing (bot/cogs/receipt.py)**
   - Added `_convert_ocr_to_receipt()` to convert OCR data to Receipt model
   - Added `_validate_receipt()` to check data integrity (items sum vs total)
   - Updated process command to use structured extraction
   - Enhanced TSV export with discount and SKU columns
   - Validation warnings shown to user when issues detected

4. **Configuration (bot/config.py, .env.example)**
   - Added `ocr_table_format` - HTML/markdown table preservation
   - Added `ocr_extract_header` - Extract header information
   - Added `ocr_use_structured_extraction` - Feature flag

**Capabilities Enabled:**

✅ Multi-line item names (Bunnings receipts)
✅ Separate unit extraction (kg, g, L, ml, ea)
✅ Discount column support (defaults to 0)
✅ Multi-language support (Korean, Chinese, English)
✅ SKU/barcode extraction
✅ Date/time parsing with fallback
✅ Store location extraction
✅ Payment method detection
✅ Data validation with user feedback

**Migration Strategy:**

- Backward compatible: regex parsing kept as fallback
- Feature flag allows disabling structured extraction
- Graceful degradation if OCR API doesn't support annotations

**Testing Priorities:**

1. Asian grocery stores (multi-language)
2. Bunnings/hardware stores (multi-line items)
3. Receipts with discount columns
4. Validation against existing HEIC test files
