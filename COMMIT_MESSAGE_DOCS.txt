Add detailed documentation of the transition from custom HTTP implementation to official Mistral SDK, including:

- Updated API Integrations section with current SDK implementation
- Added "Lesson Learned" subsection explaining the migration journey
- Documented the errors encountered with initial approach (422 errors)
- Explained user suggestion to use official SDK
- Listed benefits of SDK approach vs custom HTTP
- Updated Tech Stack to highlight mistralai package
- Updated Environment Variables to use model instead of endpoint
- Updated Dependencies section with mistralai>=1.0.0

This serves as a valuable reference for future development decisions, emphasizing the importance of using official SDKs when available.
