Refactor guess bot with OpenRouter SDK and auto-guessing

Major refactor of the guess bot to improve user experience and efficiency:

**Auto-Guessing Workflow:**
- Receipt processing now automatically triggers item name guessing
- No manual `/guess process` command needed anymore
- Batch processing sends all items in one API request

**Simplified Commands:**
- REMOVED: `/guess process` (now automatic)
- REMOVED: `/guess clear` (per user request)
- KEPT: `/guess correct` - save manual corrections
- KEPT: `/guess mappings` - view all learned corrections

**OpenRouter SDK Migration:**
- Migrated from custom HTTP calls to official `openrouter` Python SDK
- Added `openrouter>=1.0.0` to requirements.txt
- Better error handling and type safety
- Simpler, more maintainable code

**Model Update:**
- Switched from `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct` to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- Using OpenAI's cheapest model for cost efficiency
- Maintained same quality for item name guessing

**Batch Processing:**
- Implemented `guess_batch()` method for processing multiple items at once
- Single API call instead of sequential calls per item
- Faster processing and lower latency

**Updated Files:**
- bot/services/guesser.py - Complete rewrite with OpenRouter SDK and batch processing
- bot/cogs/guess.py - Removed process and clear commands, simplified to 2 commands
- bot/cogs/receipt.py - Added auto-guessing after OCR processing
- bot/config.py - Changed default model to openai/gpt-4o-mini
- bot/main.py - Updated cog initialization to pass guesser to ReceiptCog
- requirements.txt - Added openrouter>=1.0.0
- tests/test_guesser.py - Updated tests for batch processing

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better UX: Automatic workflow, no manual guessing needed
- ✅ Faster: Batch API calls vs sequential
- ✅ Cheaper: gpt-4o-mini model + batch requests
- ✅ Simpler: Fewer commands, cleaner code
- ✅ Official SDK: Better error handling and type safety
