Migrate OCR implementation to Mistral AI Python SDK

Replace custom HTTP-based OCR implementation with official mistralai package for improved reliability and maintainability.
it is clear that Claude code does not know mistral sdk well. it suggested a complicated solution that did not work and sugessted another complicated solution.
Human intervention sugessted using Mistral SDK. 
Changes:
- Update bot/services/ocr.py to use Mistral SDK instead of httpx
- Simplify OCR service based on test_mistral_api.py example
- Change model from "CX-9" to "mistral-ocr-latest"
- Update requirements.txt to include mistralai>=1.0.0
- Update config.py to use model parameter instead of endpoint
- Update bot/main.py OCR initialization for new signature
- Update tests/test_ocr.py for SDK compatibility
- Add test_mistral_api.py as reference implementation
- Add test_output directory with OCR test results

Successfully tested with Aldi receipt - extracted 748 characters of text with proper formatting and all receipt details.
